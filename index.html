                        Clash Royale is a freemium real-time strategy video game developed and published by Supercell.
                        The game combines elements from collectible card games, tower defense, 
                        and multiplayer online battle arena. 
                        The game was released globally on March 2, 2016. 
                        Clash Royale reached $1 billion in revenue in less than a year on the market.

                    <h2>Clash Royale Gameplay:</h2>
                    <p>
                        Clash Royale is a tower rush video game which pits players in games featuring two or four players (1v1 or 2v2) in which the objective is to destroy the most opposing towers, 
                        with the destruction of the "King's Tower" being an instantaneous win. 
                        After three minutes, if both of the players/teams have an equal number of crowns or none at all the match continues into a 2-minute overtime period and the player who destroys an opposing tower wins instantaneously. 
                        If no towers are destroyed during overtime, there is a tiebreaker, 
                        where all towers rapidly lose health, and the tower with the least health is destroyed. 
                        If two towers have the same health, there is a draw.
                        After an update in late 2018, leaving a 2v2 match multiple times prevents the player from playing 2v2 with random players for some time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Clash Royale, players are ranked by their number of trophies. 
                        Players level up by gaining Experience (or King Level) points through donating and upgrading cards. 
                        The highest possible level is level 13. The December 2018 Update added Star Points for excessive Experience when players reach level 13, 
                        and will award Star Points for previously leftover Experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trophies are won or lost through multiplayer battles, 
                        a player wins a battle by destroying more towers than the opponent (each destroyed tower being represented as a 'crown'), 
                        or by destroying the opponent's King's Tower, resulting in an automatic "three-crown" victory (unless the King's Tower was destroyed at the same time by both players, 
                        resulting in a draw).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are thirteen playing arenas in total (excluding the tutorial arena, Training Camp): Goblin Stadium, Bone Pit, Barbarian Bowl, P.E.K.K.A's Playhouse, Spell Valley, Builder's Workshop, Royal Arena, Frozen Peak, Jungle Arena, Hog Mountain, Electro Valley, Spooky Town, and The thirteenth arena (this arena name changes every season), with each arena corresponding to a certain trophy range. A player reaches leagues after reaching 4000 Trophies.
